# mbslisttohtml
This project will convert the text from a pdf file to html document.

I have tried parsing the pdf by using popular pdf related libraries like PyPDF2, PDFMiner and I even checked for any pdf parser to pass it to the beautifulSoup4. So, I can parse the text wtih BS4.

I found pdftotree library which is very useful in converting pdfs to html. It was developed by Fonduer with AI. The model was trained with many pdfs having tables and images in it. So, I thought I would give a try. The result is index.html. I have applied parsing on the mbslist.pdf to get different results.
